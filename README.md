# Discord Spotify Tracker üéµ

A Discord selfbot that monitors a user's Spotify activity and saves unique track URLs to a file.

**Note:** Due to me being lazy, the song playing *immediately* on joining a Listen Along party won't be saved. This is an easy fix - PRs are welcome! ‚ù§Ô∏è  

This is the 'legendary' script used to create [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1PGjUP3FVlsRwEc4leLhrd?si=3c02b963f7cc44b2). <br>
No, this is NOT exactly the same one, it's a slightly edited one that isn't fully automatic. I cannot release the full version.


## Quick Start Guide

To convert links from `list.txt` into a Spotify playlist:

1. Create a new playlist in Spotify
2. Open your `links.txt` file and select all links
3. Launch the Spotify Desktop app
4. Paste the links directly into your new playlist
5. Enjoy your new playlist!

*Contributions to improve this workflow are appreciated!*

## Features ‚ú®
- Tracks a specific user's Spotify listening activity in real-time

- npm or yarn
- A Discord account (for the selfbot)

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1. Download/Clone the Repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   nnpm install discord.js-selfbot-v13
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: This is a selfbot, which is against Discord's ToS. Use at your own risk.

   ## Usage üöÄ

1. Start the bot:
     ```bash
     node index.js
     ```
2. When prompted, enter the Discord User ID of the person you want to track.
   Preferably the 'owner' of the Listen Along Lobby (the person you joined + I recommend to have them friended or at least 3 servers in common to make it consistent)

3. The bot will:

    Monitor the target user's presence updates

    Detect when they're listening to Spotify

    Save unique track URLs to list.txt

    Display track information in the console

4. Example Output:
```  
‚úÖ Logged in as YourUsername#0000
üë§ Enter target user ID to monitor: 123456789012345678
